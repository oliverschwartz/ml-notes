\section{Statistical Learning Frameworks}
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learner's input
\begin{itemize}
\item Domain set: all objects we seek to label. Let $\mathcal{X}$ define this set.
\item Label set: all the labels we can apply to objects. Let $\mathcal{Y}$ denote the set of possible labels.
\item Training data: $S = ((x_{1},y_{1})...(x_{m},y_{m}))$ is a finite sequence of pairs in $\mathcal{X} x \mathcal{Y}$.
\end{itemize}
\item Learner's Output
\begin{itemize}
\item Prediction rule: $h: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$. This hypothesis, $h$, is generated by an algorithm which takes the learning set as input: i.e. $h = A(S)$.
\end{itemize}

\item Data generation model
\begin{itemize}
\item How is the training data generated?
\item Let us denote a probability distrubtion over $\mathcal{X}$ by $\mathcal{D}$. The learner does not know about this distribution.
\item Assume there is a "correct" labelling function, $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$, and that $y_{i} = f(x_{i})$ for all $i$. The learner is trying to figure out what this function is. 
\item Each pair in the training set, $S$, is generated by sampling a point $x_{i}$ according to $\mathcal{D}$ and labelling it by passing it to $f$.
\end{itemize}

\item Measures of success
\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{error of a classifier} is the probability that is does not predict the correct label on a random data point generated by $\mathcal{D}$. I.e. the error of $h$ is the probability to draw a random instance $x$, according to the distribution $\mathcal{D}$, such that $h(x) \neq f(x)$.
\end{itemize}


\end{itemize}
